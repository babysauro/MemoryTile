# MemoryTile ðŸŽµðŸ§©
MemoryTile is a memory game inspired by *Mahjong*, featuring musical elements to stimulate the mind through the association of images and sounds.<br>
MemoryTile emerges from the intersection of music and mental health. Inspired by research showing how Mahjong can help prevent Alzheimer's disease, this project transforms the classic game into an interactive musical experience. The project is dedicated to the memory of those who have faced this illness and their families.

## How to play ðŸŽ®
The game follows the basic rules of Mahjong, where players need to find matching pairs of tiles. In MemoryTile, the tiles feature:
- Musical instruments
- Music notation symbols
- Sound feedback corresponding to each tile's image
